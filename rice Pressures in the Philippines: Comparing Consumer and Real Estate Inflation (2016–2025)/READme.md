# Price Pressures in the Philippines: Comparing Consumer and Real Estate Inflation (2016–2025)

##  Rationale
This project analyzes how **general inflation (CPI-based)** and **real estate inflation (Residential Property Price Index)** have evolved in the Philippines from 2016–2025.  
It explores whether **property prices move in tandem with consumer prices**, and how both might respond to economic events and BSP monetary policy.

This project was created as part of my **Finance and Data Analytics portfolio**, showcasing skills in **Python, data visualization, and economic analysis**.
