#  Price Pressures in the Philippines: Comparing Consumer and Real Estate Inflation (2016–2025)

##  Overview
This project analyzes how **general inflation (CPI-based)** and **real estate inflation (Residential Property Price Index, RPPI)** have evolved in the Philippines from **2016–2025**.  
It explores whether **property prices move in tandem with consumer prices**, and how both respond to major **economic events** and **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)** monetary policy.

This project is part of my **Finance and Data Analytics portfolio**, showcasing my skills in **Python, data visualization, and economic analysis**.
